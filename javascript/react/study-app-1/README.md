### React Playground

This is the playground application I use to study and build things with React.

My idea is to have small apps like TodoApp that would depend on very few services from the main App (I want to find the right balance between DRY and decoupling).

You will see that I am using context to pass a few props down from the main wrapper app to the sub apps, initially that is for learning purpose only, I am aware of all warnings in React docs but I want to see the pros and cons myself.

Yes, Redux or MobX are good tools to manage state, but my idea is to build the sub apps without them and instead have each individual application with its own local state.

These small apps might depend on services like storage etc, ATM I think the best place to keep them is in the the wrapper app and pass them down to the sub apps, so if the wrapper app decides that storage is on the cloud it can expose this service, if another app decides storage is just local storage that can also be implemented without affecting the sub applications, its just a matter fulfilling API expectation from these services.
