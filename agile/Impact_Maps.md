### Impact mapping
Impact mapping is strategic planning technique. It prevents organizations from getting lost while building products and delivering projects, by clearly communicating assumptions, help teams align their activities with overall business objectives and make better roadmap decisions.  
Products and projects have an interdependent, dynamic relationship with people, other projects, the organization and a wider community around them. Impact maps help visualize the relationship between delivery plans and the world around them, capturing the most important assumptions as well as delivery scope. It helps reduce waste by preventing scope creep and over-engineering solutions. It provides focus for delivery by putting deliverables in the context of impacts they are supposed to achieve. It enhances collaboration by creating a shared big-picture view for technical and business people.

#### What is an impact map?
An impact map is a visualization of scope and underlying assumptions, created collaboratively, its a mind-map grown during a discussion facilitated by answering the following questions:

**WHY**: ???
**WHO**: ???
**HOW**: ???
**WHAT**: ???


### Why = Goal
This is the center of an impact map, **Why are we doing this?**
The purpose of the goal definition is to allow the delivery organization and business sponsors to re-evaluate the plan as new information becomes available, for this reason good goals tend to be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic and Timely.
Goals should not be about build products or delivering projects. They should explain why such a thing would be useful, it should present the problem to be solved.
A good approach to define a goal is: Define a model for business value first, and then define goals as increments of business value, explaining how the situation should change in the future. For commercial products try to define goals that have an obvious link to money.

eg.: Start selling online.
eg.: Improve delivery cost by 20%.

### Who = Actors
This is the first level of an impact map, it provides answers to the following questions:
  - Whose behavior we want to impact?
  - Who can produce the desired effect?
  - Who can obstruct it?
  - Who are the consumers or users of our product?
  - Who will be impacted by it?

These are the actors who can influence the outcome.

"Quality is value delivered to some person"

To deliver high-quality results we first have to understand who these people are and what kind of value they are looking for from our products or projects outcomes. In addition to those getting value we also have to consider a host of others who can make decisions that can influence the success of our product milestone or outcome of a project. Software does not work in a vacuum and it rarely controls all the actors who are involved with it. People have their own needs, goals and preferences, which all come into play if we truly care about achieving a business goal instead of just delivering software.
Impact maps make us think about all these decision-makers, user groups and customer segments. By mapping out different actors, we can prioritize work better - for example focusing on satisfying the most important actors first.

Important actors are those who can significantly influence the result and it is advisable to look at least for for three types of actors:
  - Primary actors, whose goals are fullfilled.
  - Secondary actors, who provide services.
  - Off-stage actors, who have an interest in the goal but are not directly benefitting or providing a service.

Be specific, avoid generic terms like `users` - different category of users might have different needs asnd not all users of a system might be important to consider for a specific project.

eg.: Under-18 users with a device at a concert.
eg.: Non-paying signed users.


### How = Impacts
The second level of an impact map sets the actors in the perspective of our business goals. It answers the following questions: **How should our actors' behavior change?**, **How can they help us to achieve the goal?**, **How can they obstruct or prevent us from succeeding**. These are the impacts we are trying to create.

"Key to successful delivery is to understand what jobs customers want to get done instead of their ideas about a product or service"

This helps delivery organizations investigate different technical options and explore solutions to produce good results. It also helps to focus delivery on supporting users in getting the job done instead of just delivering features.

By listing impacts on the second level of a map, we consider the desired changes in the behavior of actors. This leads to better plans and helps with prioritization. Different actors could help or obstruct us in many ways on our route to achieving the key business objectives. Some of the impacts will be competing, some conflicting, some complementary. We do not necessarily have to support all of them, but without considering delivery scope in the context of these activities it is very difficult to prioritize and compare deliverables.

The hierarchical nature of the map clearly shows who creates an impact and how that contributes to the goal. This clear visualization allows us to decide which impacts best contribute to the goal and identify the risks; this helps immensely with prioritization.  

Don't list everything an actor might want to achieve. List only the impacts that really help move you in the right direction towards the central goal.

Impacts are not product features. Avoid listing software ideas, focus on business activities.

Ideally show a change in actor behavior, not just the bahavior. Show how the activity is different from what is currently possible. So instead of just `selling tickets`, say `selling tickets five times faster`.

Important actors can often help or hinder the outcome in many different ways. Once you discover the first impact of an actor, think about what else they could do.



### What? = Deliverables
Once we have the first three questions answered, we can talk about scope. The third level of an impact map answers the following question: **What can we do, as an organization or a delivery team, to support the required impacts?**  These are the deliverables, software features and organizational activities.

Delivery plans and requirements documents are often shopping list of features, without any context that explains why such things are important. Without a clear map of deliverables to business objectives, and a justification of that mapping through impacts that need to be supported, it is incredibly difficult to argue about making or not making an investment in certain items.

An impact map pull all the deliverables in the context of the impacts that they are supposed to support. This helps with breaking deliverables down into independent chunks that provide clear business value, and helps us launch something valuable sooner. A clear hierarchy allows us to group related deliverables, compare them and avoid over-investing in less important actors or impacts. It also helps us throw out deliverables that do not really contribute to any important impact for a particular goal.

By connecting deliverables to impact and goals, a map shows the chain of reasoning that led to a feature suggestion, visualizing the assumptions of stakeholders. This allows us to scrutinize those those decisions better and re-evaluate them as new information becomes available through delivery.

Don't try to make this level complete from the start. Refine it iteratively as you deliver.
Take deliverables as options, don't take it for granted that everything listed here will actually be delivered.
Don't go into a lot of detail early on, there will be time for that later. List only high-level deliverables. You can break down high-level features into lower-level scope items, such as user stories, spines stories, basic or extension use cases later. These items can become forth, fifth or sixth level map branches.

Even on software projects, there are often ways of supporting a business activity without building software - sometimes it is cheaper to pay for advertising to recruit new players than spend months rebuilding a system. Consider anything that helps to achieve an impact.

Example of deliverables:
  - On-line ticket sales
  - Mobile home page with a purchase form
  - Optimize call center sales scripts.



### Important

Never aim to implement the whole map, instead find the shortest path through the map to the goal.



### The Role of Impact Maps
Impact mapping is a great way to communicate assumptions, create plans and align stakeholders for iterative software delivery. Impact maps also facilitate several popular product and project management practices.

When everyone involved in delivery understands the objectives, expected impacts and key assumptions in the same way, products and projects benefit from better focus and less waste. This is why goal-oriented requirements engineering methods are becoming increasingly popular in software academia.

Current goal-oriented requirements engineering practices mostly focus on the early requirements phase - they end where most traditional specification techniques would start. This provides a big picture view, but it also significantly undercuts the effectiveness of such techniques.

Iterative delivery methods and lean startup ideas place significant emphasis on integrating learning from delivery into refining scope, specifications and requirements. Upfront plans are inadequate because the landscape changes too frequently. **But iterative delivery plans often lack a big picture**.

Impact Maps bridge the two words: they facilitate strategic planning and thinking to create a big-picture view focused on key business objectives, but also facilitate learning through delivery and help us manage project roadmaps. They represent and organize delivery scope in a way that is easy to evolve, reprioritize, grow and shrink as necessary to react to changed market opportunities or new knowledge.

  - Strategic planning
    Impact mapping is a great way to engage senior business and technical experts at the start of work on a product module or project milestone to create a shared understanding of scope.

  - Defining quality
    An impact map clearly shows the impacts that technical deliverables are supposed to produce from a business perspective.

  - Roadmap management
    An impact map communicates scope, goals and priorities, but also assumptions on two levels. The first is that a deliverable will cause a change in behavior of an actor, produce an impact. The second is that once the impact is achieved, the relevant actor will contribute to the overall objectives.


### Impact Maps Solve Common Problems

  - Scope creep
    Because there is a clear mapping from deliverables to goals, we can measure when the main objective is reached and stop working on it.

  - Wrong solutions
    Because impact maps put deliverables int he context of business goals, it is trivially easy to spot solutions looking for a problem, or those that would contribute to a different business objective.

  - Pet features
    Impact maps allow us to quickly spot suggested features that do not support any of the desired activities or do not contribute to the overall goal.

  - Wrong assumptions
    Even with the best insight, if market opportunities change, it is impossible to know that a solution is no longer relevant unless underlying assumptions are clearly communicated. Impact maps clearly show assumptions so that we can track and validate them.

  - Ad-hoc prioritization
    Without a clear understanding of the business context, it is difficult to know that we are really working on the most important things. Impact maps put features in the context of behavior impacts, allowing stakeholders to relate better to benefits they would get from feature and make much better prioritization decisions. We can make decisions based on which impacts to support first, or which actors to satisfy, building together all the necessary deliverables to achieve this goal. This significantly reduces time to market.


### Delivering business goals, not just features
Current practices for mapping project goals and communicating requirements fail to deliver business outcomes, because explaining `Why` and `Watch out for` is very important in a fast-moving landscape such as software delivery. This is what goal-oriented requirements practices try to achieve. The idea of goal-oriented requirements practices is to focus projects on supporting usage goals and behaviors impacts, instead of pre-set features or tasks.
Scott Berkun used a simple mapping between goals, features and requirements to prevent scope creep while managing the Excel development program at Microsoft. He got the stakeholders to agree on a limit on the number of business goals for a release. Then he eliminated superfluous scope by insisting that each feature references a requirement it fulfils, and that each requirement references the goal it supports. Berkun wrote that such mapping allowed his teams to decide which features should or should not be part of a delivery, which one should be reprioritized when business goals changes and which were critical for success.

Impact maps facilitate this process, taking it event further. Instead of just connecting feature and goals at the start of a product milestone or a project, impact maps allow us to maintain a dynamic roadmap that changes with our learning., keeping the goals in mind and making features and scope secondary to it. We visualize assumptions, which allows us to change direction once these assumptions are proven or discarded.

For example, in a online gaming system we have the purpose of semi-automated invites is to support players inviting their friends. We assume that delivering that feature will change players' behavior. Once the feature is delivered, we can track if the assumption was true or not. If player invite friends, we can keep investing in that branch. If not, we should stop, analyze the situation, and try to do something else about it.

The map also shows a higher level assumption. If players send out invitations, we assume that their friends will actually come to play our games. After each deliverable is shipped in the invitation area of the map, we can measure if new players are responding to the invitations at expected rates. if yes, we should continue to expand this area. If not, building more ways for people to send out invitations would be wrong. We should re-think our strategy, find a way to improve invitation results or perhaps o something else.
