### Impact mapping
Impact mapping is strategic planning technique. It prevents organizations from getting lost while building products and delivering projects, by clearly communicating assumptions, help teams align their activities with overall business objectives and make better roadmap decisions.  
Products and projects have an interdependent, dynamic relationship with people, other projects, the organization and a wider community around them. Impact maps help visualize the relationship between delivery plans and the world around them, capturing the most important assumptions as well as delivery scope. It helps reduce waste by preventing scope creep and over-engineering solutions. It provides focus for delivery by putting deliverables in the context of impacts they are supposed to achieve. It enhances collaboration by creating a shared big-picture view for technical and business people.

#### What is an impact map?
An impact map is a visualization of scope and underlying assumptions, created collaboratively, its a mind-map grown during a discussion facilitated by answering the following questions:

**WHY**: ???
**WHO**: ???
**HOW**: ???
**WHAT**: ???


### Why = Goal
This is the center of an impact map, **Why are we doing this?**
The purpose of the goal definition is to allow the delivery organization and business sponsors to re-evaluate the plan as new information becomes available, for this reason good goals tend to be SMART: Specific, Measurable, Action-oriented, Realistic and Timely.
Goals should not be about build products or delivering projects. They should explain why such a thing would be useful, it should present the problem to be solved.
A good approach to define a goal is: Define a model for business value first, and then define goals as increments of business value, explaining how the situation should change in the future. For commercial products try to define goals that have an obvious link to money.

eg.: Start selling online.
eg.: Improve delivery cost by 20%.

### Who = Actors
This is the first level of an impact map, it provides answers to the following questions:
  - Whose behavior we want to impact?
  - Who can produce the desired effect?
  - Who can obstruct it?
  - Who are the consumers or users of our product?
  - Who will be impacted by it?

These are the actors who can influence the outcome.

"Quality is value delivered to some person"

To deliver high-quality results we first have to understand who these people are and what kind of value they are looking for from our products or projects outcomes. In addition to those getting value we also have to consider a host of others who can make decisions that can influence the success of our product milestone or outcome of a project. Software does not work in a vacuum and it rarely controls all the actors who are involved with it. People have their own needs, goals and preferences, which all come into play if we truly care about achieving a business goal instead of just delivering software.
Impact maps make us think about all these decision-makers, user groups and customer segments. By mapping out different actors, we can prioritize work better - for example focusing on satisfying the most important actors first.

Important actors are those who can significantly influence the result and it is advisable to look at least for for three types of actors:
  - Primary actors, whose goals are fullfilled.
  - Secondary actors, who provide services.
  - Off-stage actors, who have an interest in the goal but are not directly benefitting or providing a service.

Be specific, avoid generic terms like `users` - different category of users might have different needs asnd not all users of a system might be important to consider for a specific project.

eg.: Under-18 users with a device at a concert.
eg.: Non-paying signed users.


### How = Impacts
